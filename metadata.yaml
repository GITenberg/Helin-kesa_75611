summary: '"Helin kesä" by Eva Hirn is a novel written in the early 20th century. The
  story centers around Heli, a young woman navigating her academic pursuits, familial
  expectations, and social life in a transitional period marked by evolving gender
  roles. Readers are introduced to Heli''s struggles with her responsibilities and
  ambitions as she contemplates her future and seeks independence.  The opening of
  the novel establishes Heli''s character, showcasing her dedication to her studies
  in science while managing her household duties as the only daughter among brothers.
  Heli''s conversations with her friends, particularly Meri, reveal their aspirations,
  societal pressures, and the contrasting challenges they face as women. As Heli articulates
  her desire for freedom from domestic constraints, she reveals plans to take on a
  summer job as a servant in a wealthy household, aiming to experience life away from
  her current environment. This decision sets the stage for her adventures and explorations
  of class and identity that may unfold as the story progresses. (This is an automatically
